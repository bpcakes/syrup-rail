# Repository Guidelines

## Security and privacy baseline

- Read [docs/security/threat-model.md](./docs/security/threat-model.md) before
  changing credential handling, payment evidence, financial retention, or
  privileged operator workflows.
- Host applications remain responsible for authenticating and authorizing a
  subject before invoking Syrup Rail. These crates do not create an alternate
  application security boundary.

<!-- BEGIN JIG MANAGED BLOCK -->
This repository uses the shared `jig.sh` workflow. Keep repo-local business rules and ownership guidance in crate-level guides; keep generic agent workflow and repo policy here.

## Start Here

- Use this file for repo-wide defaults.
- Open [agent-map.md](./agent-map.md) before backend work.
- Read the nearest crate-level `AGENTS.md` before changing a crate when one exists.
- Use `.agent/PLANS.md` when writing an ExecPlan for a complex feature or refactor.
- Use `scripts/jig` for the typed repo contract and `scripts/jig mcp` for MCP clients.
- On a fresh machine, run `scripts/jig doctor`; follow its next step, including `scripts/jig agent bootstrap` when Jig Codex skills are missing.
- For substantial work, use `scripts/jig work start`, `scripts/jig work check`, `scripts/jig work evidence`, `scripts/jig work gates`, and `scripts/jig work finish` to keep plans, receipts, and required gates connected.
- Treat `.agent/state/*.jsonl` as append-only repo memory.

## Compatibility And Cutovers

- Prefer direct cutovers only for internal code-only changes that can ship in one coordinated deploy.
- Preserve compatibility or stage rollouts for persisted database state, queued job types, public API contracts, bookmarked routes, webhook boundaries, or source-of-truth moves that can straddle deploys.

- Never overwrite an existing database migration; add a new forward-only migration instead.


## Backend Defaults

- Treat `crates` as Rust crate roots.
- Add crate-level `AGENTS.md` files when a crate has meaningful ownership, entrypoint, or invariant guidance that should travel with that crate.

- Versioned SQL schema artifacts live under
  `crates/syrup-rail-postgres/schema`; follow the crate guide for the current
  artifact and immutable shipped versions.
- SQLx metadata is committed in `crates/syrup-rail-postgres/.sqlx`.

- Keep transport logic thin and business logic in the owning crate.

- Keep transaction boundaries explicit and deterministic.


## Frontend Defaults

No web apps are configured in `.jig.toml`.


## Preferred Commands

- `scripts/jig bootstrap`
- `scripts/jig doctor`
- `scripts/jig dev`
- `scripts/jig check test`
- `scripts/jig check fmt`
- `scripts/jig check clippy`
- `scripts/jig work status`
- `scripts/jig work evidence`


- `scripts/jig check sqlx`

- `scripts/jig check contract`

## Done Means

- Run the relevant local verification for the area you changed.
- For backend changes, finish with `scripts/jig check test`.


- For SQLx or migration changes, run `scripts/jig check sqlx`.


- Review the generated diff for stale docs, policy drift, or missing dependent updates.

## Crate Guide Conventions

When a backend crate has a crate-level `AGENTS.md`, use these sections:

- `## Purpose`
- `## Key entrypoints`
- `## Edit here for X`
- `## Invariants`
- `## Common commands`
<!-- END JIG MANAGED BLOCK -->

## Repository-specific schema workflow

The PostgreSQL distribution schema uses complete versioned artifacts, not a
flat SQLx migration directory. Schema v6 is current and `schema/v1/**` through
`schema/v5/**` are immutable. Do not use
`scripts/jig migration-add` for these artifacts; edit the current version only
when it has not shipped, and otherwise add the next forward-only version and
cutover artifact as directed by the PostgreSQL crate guide.

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses a Beads tracker—either the Go `bd` CLI or the Rust `br` CLI—for issue tracking, plus [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) (`bv`) for graph-aware triage. Issues are stored in `.beads/`. `bv` auto-discovers supported JSONL exports, including `.beads/issues.jsonl` and legacy `.beads/beads.jsonl`.

**Choose the tracker CLI from this repository's instructions and configuration.** Use `bd` commands in a Go Beads workspace and `br` commands in a beads_rust workspace. Do not run both trackers against the same workspace or infer the tracker solely from the JSONL filename.

### Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects. Instead of parsing .beads/issues.jsonl / .beads/beads.jsonl directly or hallucinating graph traversal, use robot flags for deterministic, dependency-aware outputs with precomputed metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, k-core).

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). The selected tracker CLI (`bd` or `br`) handles creating, claiming, modifying, and closing beads.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY --robot-* flags. Bare bv launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

#### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns everything you need in one call:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command

# Token-optimized output (TOON) for lower LLM context usage:
bv --robot-triage --format toon
```

Before claiming, verify current state with the selected tracker: `br show <id> --json`/`br ready --json` or `bd show <id> --json`/`bd ready --json`. `recommendations` can include graph-important blocked or assigned work; only `quick_ref.top_picks` and non-empty `claim_command` fields represent claimable work.

#### Other bv Commands

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with unblocks lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions, cycle breaks |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |

#### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work (no blockers)
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank scores
```

### Tracker Commands for Issue Management

Use exactly one command family, matching the tracker configured for the repository.

#### Rust beads_rust (`br`)

```bash
br ready --json                       # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open --json          # All open issues
br show <id> --json                   # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2 --json
br update <id> --status=in_progress --json
br close <id> --reason="Completed" --json
br close <id1> <id2> --reason="Completed" --json
br sync --flush-only                  # Export DB to JSONL after Beads mutations
```

#### Go Beads (`bd`)

```bash
bd ready --json                       # Show issues ready to work
bd show <id> --json                   # Full issue details
bd create "..." -t task -p 2 --json
bd update <id> --claim --json         # Atomically claim work
bd close <id> --json
bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>
bd export --no-memories -o .beads/beads.jsonl  # Refresh the export read by bv
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Triage**: Run `bv --robot-triage` to find the highest-impact actionable work
2. **Verify**: Check the selected tracker's `show`/`ready` output before claiming
3. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress --json` or `bd update <id> --claim --json`
4. **Work**: Implement the task
5. **Complete**: Use the selected tracker's `close` command
6. **Refresh for bv**: Run `br sync --flush-only` or the `bd export` command above so the JSONL export is current

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready --json` and `bd ready --json` show unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers 0-4, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, chore, docs, question
- **Blocking**: Use `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` or `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Git Policy

Tracker commands do not grant permission to commit or push application code. Follow this repository's own git and tracker instructions before staging, committing, syncing, or pushing. If the repository says "commit only when asked," that rule overrides any generic workflow advice.
